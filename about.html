                <h2>Okay, but what is it?</h2>

                <p>
                    'Finding Joy in Your Everyday' is a collaborative art project that started as an assignment for school and turned into a passion project/portfolio piece. It is fueled by my interests in positivity, gratitude, and digital minimalism. The project's overall goals are to help people notice how much good is in their life, learn to appreciate what they have, and become a little happier in doing so. I also hope to contribute positively to the Internet and provide a space where there is no judgement, comparison, or competition. We currently have 60+ submissions and growing.
                </p>

                <h2>How did I make it...</h2>
                <p>
                    <span id="emphasize">First</span>, I established project goals and deliverables. I decided that displaying my project on a website would be the most accessible, and would be fairly attainable given my skillset. I also identified online communities that would be suitable for outreach.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span id="emphasize">Next</span>, I composed a Google Form to be used for data collection. At this time I also wrote two example submissions to provide participants guidance on what was expected. I proofread the form and tested it multiple times before sending it out to various Reddit and Discord servers. To streamline this process, I drafted some copy text to introduce the project and give a bit of context, which served as a basis for each post.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <span id="emphasize">Consistently and over time</span>, I posted about the project in a variety of servers/subreddits to facilitate a consistent and diverse stream of responses. Meanwhile, I built the initial implementation of the website, which was pretty basic and lacked the color that you see now.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span id="emphasize">Finally</span>, I did a major redesign of the website to make it a more visually appealing. Additionally, I added a couple new features, such as filtering and this About page, to make it easier to navigate and, ultimately, feel more complete/polished. Overall, I'm pleased with how it turned out and look forward to seeing how it grows over time as I continue to maintain it.
