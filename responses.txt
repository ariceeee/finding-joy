I love when I'm crocheting small flowers. I watch the thin, cotton yarn slowly transform from string, to chain, to petals, and finally to a full and beautiful flower. With each one I make, I think about how they're going to look as a bouquet and the joy people will have when they see it.
Showering is always the best part of my day. Just the coolness of water on my skin, the scents of soap and shampoo, that squeaky clean feeling, having a little brain nap as I do my skincare after. I just instantly feel better.
One of my favorite parts of my morning is just getting up and washing my face first thing after I wake up. Cold refreshing water to help energize myself and starting my day with an act of self care.
I love it when people thank bus drivers before they get off at their stop. Sometimes they wave, too. And when the bus driver waves back, it feels like you've made a connection with that person, however short your time with them was.
Opening a window to a thunderstorm outside. It's just before sunset and the smell and sound of rain fills the room as I sit on the bed. It's summer. The thrum of the rain and bass of the thunder quiets something restless in me.
The days get a little longer by the day. At 5:12 the sky remains bright, as if with each day's passing, the day grows in its endurance against the heaviness of the night, bearing the lantern a moment more at a time. It reminds me that much perseverance may not see its fruits by the end of one day, but the passage of days stands testimony to it
I love changing the lighting in my room throughout the day. In the morning, the big lights go on and I get ready. After class, as I suffer through my engineering assignments, I turn the big light off and open the blinds to let in the light from the floodlights on the commons field, and I turn on my desk lamp. I set the lamp to cool light if I really need to lock in, or warm if I'm not questioning all my decisions and actually want to see tomorrow. When I relax in the evening, the blinds are shut and the desk lamp turned off again and I turn on the lamp on my nightstand, filling the room with warm light. I turn my big string lights on and my little star lights, making it feel all cozy and magical. Once it gets to the late evening when I do my manic pacing for 2 hours, the lamp is turned off and the string lights are dimmed, giving me the privacy of darkness. Just before I get in bed, I turn my star lights off because I can't reach them from my bed. As I lay in bed and actually go to sleep, I turn off my string lights with my little remote. The room goes dark except for the light of the red leaf on the thermostat telling me that turning the heat on maximum isn't eco-friendly. Then I go to sleep and start the light routine all over again. Controlling the ambience around me is such a small part of my day in the grand scheme of things, but it gives me routine and control and a little bit of joy in my everyday life.
My New Year's Resolution for the year is to try and get 10K steps every day (and if not, at least average over 10K steps a month) so every evening after dinner I go out to the park near my house and walk around the track until I hit 10K. I'll do that while listening to music and reading ebooks or playing games. It's super relaxing, love the cool wind, love seeing dogs, love seeing the fellow regulars. Absolutely bangs.
Playing fetch with my dog at the park
Studying in the middle of the night, looking out at the city lights while I’m listening to my favourite song
The simple act of going for a walk outside; the sun shining, weather calm and peaceful. Perhaps alone, or in the company of a few loved ones as you perambulate along slowly enjoying the moment you have been given.
Walking in the rain. Not pouring rain, just a drizzle. Makes me feel so alive
I like to find little pockets of space throughout my day, and just exist in them: waiting for water to boil, waiting for the shower to heat up, waiting for the bus to come, waiting in line at the checkout. They don't last long and it's easy to try and fill them, but don't. We are always moving, multitasking, filling our days to the brim, checking our phone. At some point, we just have to breathe. Take this time, it is yours and only yours. I have grown to thoroughly enjoy the act of waiting.
I really like talking to myself. Not in an insane way, but more like almost parenting myself, or just getting thoughts off my chest. The fact that I have the ability to produce speech, hear myself, and speak my mind with no limitations is incredible. And it's so powerful. It makes me so happy just telling myself positive things. Giving myself the encouragement I never got as a kid. It's healing.
How people's entire face changes when they laugh. People are not so much an image as they are an experience, with sights as well as sounds and feels.
Wearing matching pajamas and cozy slippers
Tucking myself into bed. Specifically, pulling the blanket under my feet. That little action feels so loving and cared for, makes me feel like a kid again.
Dancing. Silly, goofy, in the comfort of my own home. Low effort or full out. Alone or with my partner. Not caring what I look like or how good I am or how I felt before I started. For 20 seconds or 5 minutes or doing a 30 minute follow-along on YouTube. Dancing changes my mood in the most substantial way, always for the better, and it makes me feel more connected to <i>me</i>.
Petting dogs, who don't care who you are or how much money you make or what happened throughout your day or what you're feeling or how put together you look. Dogs, who simply exist for the present moment, and lean into it fully and happily.
Braiding my hair. Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right. Something about the rhythm of it. And the act of pulling my hair back, both practical for the activities of my day, and as a way to say, albeit quietly, that I accept the way I look. That I don't want anything to distract or cover my face. I want it on display, because it is mine, and I like it.
Being fully immersed in what you're doing. Time slips through your fingers; the ticking clock seems to melt. It's just you and that thing you're working on. Just you and the thoughts, the passion, the art. Right now, the stress, the bullshit, it doesn't matter. Right now you are in this moment. You *are* the moment. You are not consuming, you are creating. You are not watching, you are acting. You are a verb. And when it is over, when, at last, you must stow away your paintbrush or your laptop, you feel lighter. You feel accomplished. Because it is a real valuable thing to create something, in a world that shoves content down your throat like it's medicine.
Sending a voice-recording of me singing "Happy Birthday" to my long distance friend. It's so small and easy to do, yet if someone did that for me, I would be absolutely overjoyed. I imagine anyone would be. So, I do it for her, every single year without fail.
When you're with someone and you know them well enough that the silence isn't awkward. It's comfortable. You don't have to explain yourself and they don't have to explain themselves and you can just be there with each other. Doing your own thing, but doing it in the same space.
When I make bread, I always cut "taste test" pieces for myself: the two ends. Some people think they're the worst parts of the loaf, but I actually think they're the best, when the bread is fresh. I wait until the loaf is <i>almost</i> completely cooled, but still a bit warm, because, let's face it, I just can't help myself. Then I cut them carefully with a serrated blade, warm them up in the toaster, and butter them. The taste is simply exquisite, not to mention the aroma. Just me in my tiny little kitchen, enjoying fresh bread that I made for myself.
Waking up in the middle of the night, checking the clock, and seeing it's still very much night,  so you can go back to bed and sleep some more.
Putting on clothes that are still warm from the dryer
I like taking myself to coffee shops alone. Usually I bring a book. I love the atmosphere. The smell of pastries and coffee beans. Seeing everyone gathering for one reason or another. Grandparents. Moms and dads. Children. Friends. Couples. Colleagues. Acquaintances. Catching tidbits of conversation, tail ends of laughter. Really, it's being surrounded by life. Reminding myself that it's not just me out here.
When you make a really good meal. Like first bite and it's just AHHHHHHHHHHH THIS IS SO GOOOOOOOD. You feel like Martha Stewart or Gordon Ramsey or perhaps a god.
I love when a dog is dreaming and sometimes their little legs move as though they're running. Or their tail wags. It's hilarious and also very cute.
I am grateful to have a fireplace in my apartment. I love sitting by it in the early morning or late at night to take the chill off.
Tea.<br>Steeped too bitter, made too sweet.<br>Not only with sugar. Add maple or honey, or use juice instead of water.<br>A shock to the senses, a jolt of energy goes with the flavor. Hot enough to burn the tongue, small sips til it’s almost done.<br>Don’t finish it.<br>Added water, steeped further in the fridge.<br>A cold drink, the next day.
When I come home from a long day and greet my partner. Or vice versa, when my partner comes home and I greet him. The moment lasts for less than a minute, but it really makes me happy. And it's the consistency of it, knowing that I always have that to look forward to, no matter how hectic my day was. There's something so grounding about it.
Doing dishes in the evening before bed. It makes me feel better mentally, like I'm wrapping up the day and transitioning to relaxation time. But it also feels like an act of self love to my future self, who's going to wake up to a clean kitchen and have an easier start to her day.
Telling a joke that genuinely makes people laugh. Doesn't happen often, because my jokes are usually pretty cringe, but when it does it's awesome
The feeling of accomplishment I get after completing a challenging task, or finally knocking that thing I didn't want to do off of my todo list
Fresh flowers. Of any kind. Just the $5 ones at the grocery store are absolutely perfect. Some people think fresh flowers are a waste of money, because they die so quickly. I used to be one of those people. But then I heard someone say that that's the whole point of fresh flowers. We enjoy them while they're alive and then their time comes and we get rid of them. They are like that on purpose, to teach us to be in the moment, and just enjoy things while they're happening, as they are. Now I find that I love flowers.
Having a chat with someone that leaves you feeling lighter. Someone who lifts you up and makes you feel happy to be alive.
Seeing a dog. Bonus points if you get to pet the dog.
Doing something for someone else that you know they're going to appreciate. That you know is going to make their day or their week or their month just a little bit easier. Or maybe a lot easier. That's what love is all about. Putting someone else's needs above your own, not because they need you to, but because you can and because you want to and because it'll help them breathe a little easier.
Quails don't run across the road. They scuttle. A bunch of them. In this chaotic, silly rush of energy. You walk by a bush that was seemingly empty but no, it's not empty, there's a dozen bumbling quails that come stumbling out in a kerfuffle of feathers and feet. Never fails to make me chuckle. 
Going to someone's house and finding really nice smelling hand soap in their bathroom. Especially around Christmas time. All the cinnamon spice sugar berry scents make me feel so warm and fuzzy inside.
I like when I notice little changes in my neighborhood: Oh, that house is for sale! Oh, they're renovating their deck! Oh, they got a new car! It makes me feel like I'm part of it, like I belong. The fact that I've lived in this place long enough that I notice things like that, that an outsider would not.
Putting on an outfit that just <i>feels</i> good. You look at yourself in the mirror and LOVE how it looks. You feel confident. You feel comfortable. You feel sure of yourself. It suits you. And you carry that good vibe with you throughout your day.
Being home alone and just <i>feeling</i> how quiet it is. Not trying to hide from that, not trying to color over the quiet with music or tv, but just letting it be. Slowing down. Savouring it like it's a piece of chocolate cake. Knowing that it will not last forever, but also that it will come again, so there is no need for frugality, to nibble at it crumb by precious crumb. You can enjoy it fully and completely for what it is, without feeling selfish nor silly.
Playing board games. Particularly, with good company. Especially in today's world where so many things are on a screen. There's something so special about just sitting down with people you like, people who get you, chatting, laughing, and becoming fully engaged in what you're doing. I love the fun competition, I love the immersion, I love just forgetting about the big problems everyone's facing and coming together. No matter how crazy the world gets, you can always stay in and play a board game. It's no solution, but that's not the point; it's about taking this time to be present, and challenge your mind in a way that many of us stop doing once we get older and settle into our routine. It also makes my inner child happy, and reminds me of those good times when I was a kid, gathered around the kitchen table playing Monopoly or Sorry or Clue.
Playing couch co-op games with my partner. It's so comforting, and just plain fun. It's more effort/involvement than just throwing on a show, but it's nothing crazy, so it still works as a way to unwind after a long day. Overall I just love it as a way to connect, while also allowing us to detach from the stress of the day. Reminds me of when we first started dating.
Step outside and the sun is shining. Blue sky, gold light. It's warm on your face, your hands, whatever parts of you it can find. You squint your eyes. It only smiles brighter in response, stronger, bigger.  You breathe in. Breathe out. And suddenly, it's going to be okay. You're alright.
I really enjoy grocery shopping and meal prepping. It's a bit of work, but there's nothing like that feeling when it's all done and you look at your fridge and there's fresh produce ready to go, a couple meal options you enjoy, breakfast for the week, snacks in the pantry, a freezer stocked with proteins and easy veggie options. Sometimes I do a more minimal version, while others I will go full-out and prep almost everything. I like that I can adapt it to my energy levels and how I'm feeling that week. It brings me so much joy knowing that I'm looking after myself and I won't have to think about what I'm eating for the rest of the week. Knowing that I've got options that will keep me fueled and nourished.
When you try a new recipe and take the first bite and it's just incredible. Like okay, now that is something I'm going to have to make again! It's exciting and rewarding and makes you feel like a chef.
Listening to my hometown's radio station. It's so nostalgic and helps me cope with moving so far away. You hear the radio host's voice, you hear the local advertisements, the weather, and it's almost like a part of you is there.
A hug from someone you love, especially when it's not out of obligation or habit. But just, organic. Wanted. When neither party is rushing to get out of it.
Getting home and realizing that you have no lingering school work to do, no tests to study for, nothing. You got it all done at school. Now you can just relax. Do whatever you want, or nothing at all if you choose.
When you're talking with someone and they remind you of something, a memory, or whatever, that you haven't thought of in sooooo long. You have that epiphany moment of, "Oh yeah! I almost forgot about that!!!" It's like you've unlocked a part of you that's both new and old, and you get to share that moment of reflection with the person. Bonus points if it's something funny or embarrassing.
Finding a piece of clothing at the thrift store that you LOVE, has no holes, rips, or stains, and then getting it home and it fits BEAUTIFULLY. Then you wash it and finally wear it for the first time and are just HAPPY. When people compliment it and ask where you got it, it's so cool to just be all nonchalant, like "Oh, I thrifted it for $10".
Going to bed on time or early. Makes you feel like you've got your shit together.
That little wave that people do when they're crossing the street. It's so weird and silly and yet if you don't do it, you're kind of a jerk. No matter how old you are, no matter how much money you have, you <i>have</i> to do the little "thank you" wave when you cross the street. And then the person in the vehicle does the wave back, or nods in acknowledgement! It's so cute.
Grandparents. The way they talk, and the things they talk about. How they're just so down to earth. How they seem to know something about pretty much anything. How they've held so many roles throughout their life, been so many things to so many people. How they carry on despite their health conditions and mobility limitations, still smiling and cracking jokes.
Dressing up for no reason at all. Putting on a cute outfit that's a bit elevated from what you usually wear. Doing your hair. Putting on a little makeup. Maybe a dash of perfume. Picking out jewelry. You'll find it's a lot of fun, dressing up for yourself and yourself alone, and there's absolutely no stress.
When you watch a movie or read a book and are brought to tears. But instead of fighting it you just lean into it. You let the story reel you in, and you feel it, you feel it all. You empathize with the character fully, you appreciate the experience for what it is. I mean, how beautiful is it that we are capable of feeling things so very deeply, which we did not and cannot experience? And that some people can capture those things in such perfect detail that they may be felt as though they are real, right here in front of us
You ever notice how people's entire energy changes when they're talking about something that interests them? Like their face lights up, their body language shifts, and they have this excitement about them wasn't there before. It's incredible to see the transformation, and I think it's so cool when someone lets you into that part of their world. Makes me happy to see the people I care about excited about something.
