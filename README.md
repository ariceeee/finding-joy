# Finding Joy In Your Everyday

By: Ariana Rice

This repo contains the source code for a website that I developed to display my final project for the course COSC101.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, JSON, and [tiiny.host](https://tiiny.host/) for deployment.

## About

'Finding Joy In Your Everyday' is a mass artistic collaboration with submissions gathered from online communities including Discord and Reddit. 
It is fueled by my interests in positivity, gratitude, and digital minimalism. 
The project's overall goals are to help people notice the good in their life, learn to appreciate what they have, and become a little happier in doing so. 
Additionally, I hope to contribute to the Internet in a positive way. 
We currently have 60+ submissions and growing.
